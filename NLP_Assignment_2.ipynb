Cozy  and comfortable Hotel!  The best personalized one! All the employees are congratulated! Very nice taste, since reception to the end of the stay! We were welcome with tea and cake, as I have gluten aversion,, all the employees already knew and were waiting carefully. At night, we were received in the fire pits, with some wine and all the guests were invited to participate and interact. \\n\"Hotel concept is hard to grasp. They communicate environmental sustainability, through fashionable buzzwords like upcycling but they use pillows made out of duck feathers!?!\\nPricing is utterly ridiculous, for what you get.\\nBreakfast has high-quality products, but it lacks in choice.\\nService is friendly, although \"\"too friendly\"\" at times.\\nOverall experience was ok, but you can get much better alternatives for lower prices.\"\\nThis is a wonderful hotel, for a romantic escape. Every room has a theme, and is incredible, overlooking the sea, the sustainable concept of the hotel is excellent, modern design, the staff and owners will make your stay memorable! You will have to make a toast with the free red wine around the bonfire!\\nGold room fantastic. We loved and we will come back! \\nOne of the best Hotels in the world, and in the treatment is the best!!! Room Mi Ma Bo is fantastic! Poetry all over the place.        \\n Land Room is wonderful! An amazing place, as something special. We have loved it and we hope to come back here soon!!        \\n One of the greatest meals ever. Everything was fantastic! Since the special attention in the treatment, every single details thought about the room in order to create a cozy environment all over the place.         \\n     A peaceful place, built with a lot of taste and excellent service. Congratulations, we will come back for sure.        \\n     Thank you for a wonderful stay! Very sad to be going home!         \\n     It\\'s one of the most beautiful places we have been to - magical world. Speechless & full of grace\\x85 Thanks to the team of Areias do Seixo for this wonderful stay!        \\n     Thanks for the stay in this wonderful Hotel.        \\n     A five star stay, starting by people to the stay itself. See you soon.        \\n     One dream. Coming back again is not even a question. Yes, loved the whole experience. The staff was excellent. Many congrats!   Only feedback would be to expand the cocktail selection.     \\n\"Joana: thank you for being always available. Claudia: thank you for your grace and support Filipe: thank you for your smile and joy for life. Kiki: your bread is to die for and your care and through your green goddess juice was touching, as well as your presence and power. Leonardo: thank you for creative flair and for accommodating our special requests in a natural way making us feel at home. Maria: thank you for your senility in asking \"\"May I enter?\"\" and for always carrying a warm smile. Sergio: your cave and warmth was a gift    Our gratitude to you all for all that you give. Thank you Areas Do Seixo for all of your light, your giving, your spaciousness and timelessness. We felt genuinely cared for from a place of love and generosity, far beyond the call of duty. From the interior design to the food, from the sunlight to the connection with nature, everything seems to be riding on a very special energy. If Heaven now and then touches the Earth, it does at Areas Do Seixo.        \"\\n\"     We had a truly memorable and delightful stay at Areas do Seixo. After some difficulty in finding it (GPS was helpful), we knew the moment we walked in that this was a special place. The sign for the turn off was quite small; the front door was locked, but immediately opened. Definitely a secluded retreat on a holiday weekend (we checked in on Jan. 1). The seating at the check in desk was swings. Below the clear floors was water. Through the windows you could see the grass roofs of the below-street-level rooms. Each room is unique, we were told. Ours featured a bathroom with a sunken tub/shower, a window for a ceiling, an olive tree growing, and a fireplace. You get the idea. It may not be for everyone, but for us, we got our money\\'s worth. We appreciate innovation, design, beauty, and seclusion. Areas do Seixo had it all. Look at the photos and see if it might be for you too. It is a splurge for sure. But they deliver. For us, Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, California is the only place that has come close. One note: thank goodness for TripAdvisor\\'s quote service - we found the room only on Despegar.com, which we found from TripAdvisor.        \"\\n\"     We were totally charmed by the Hotel. A unique place, a magical atmosphere that invite relax and relax! A real change of scenery! We were impressed by the architecture of the hotel and its total integration with nature. The Neha Crotchet room was absolutely perfect  with a sublime decoration (as in the whole hotel). Breakfast was delicious and balanced, very fresh and varied. The same for the restaurant. We went impressed by the quality of the products, their freshness, beautiful tasty and original dishes. The staff either at reception as in the restaurant was lovely. We thank the kitchen staff for offering bread that we could bring home. The floral massage spa was very nice and full. And yoga was top! In short, it was an unforgettable experience in a magical place. We will come back, for sure! We also loved the music played in the hotel, what is your playlist? \\nAnother big thank you for all the team!         \"\\n A lovely and warm place, food from the professional Chef Leonardo Pereira, with a lot of good surprises, unexpected and keeping up with a careful explanation. Enjoyed particularly the desserts, but also noting the main course and the entries.        Nice service, maybe a little scattered.     \\n     Is, without any doubt, an amazing place, with a sophisticated and fine décor, without forgetting about comfort. The unpretentious environment, cozy, quiet and with a fantastic view, it allows us to relax and enjoy a whole unique experience.          For our deception, we couldn\\'t enjoy a night well seeped, caused by the constant noise of the fireplace, due to the wind night. We have tried to stop the noise without success and the noise just stopped in the morning. Despite this to be an amazing hotel to all levels (excellent service, comfort, kindness, décor, location, etc.) this type of things as to be taken into account, as we can come back or recommend this hotel. If to rest properly we depend on weather or it was just in our room? (7 senses room)\\n\"     \\n\"\"Once in a while one can find excellent 5* hotels, well located, clean, comfortable and with all the amenities. We\\'ve found and enjoyed some of these around the world. Not so often you come across hotels that go beyond this and make you question everything else you\\'ve seen and experienced. This is one of them. \\nThe photos on the site surely don\\'t express all the attention to detail and the harmony in the choices, the simplicity of the materials and the smell of natural essences all around. The care we received as guests and all the personalized treats made us feel at home among friends and in our opinion rank this hotel as one of the best, relaxed places in Portugal and in the world, and a sure return destination.\"\"        \"\\n A magical place! Every single detail seems to be well thought. Spend the night there and have dinner in the restaurant, the food was nice,  but the order took a bit to arrive. The service was very nice.       The order took a bit to arrive. The price is considered high, but in this fantastic hotel it is forgiven.     \\n\" The restaurant, under the command of Chef Leonardo Pereira, who worked several years in \"\"Nomad\"\" in Dina mark is absolutely wonderful. Food is made with a lot of love and respect for nature. They have their own garden, where ingredients are taken. Amazing, delicious, tasty food, which makes us happier every time a dish is served.     We went to the Hotel Areas do Seixo to have lunch in the restaurant\\x85When we arrive we have notice the modern architecture, clean and extremely cozy. The place has an amazing energy, which makes us to look on every single detail. A unique service, people from all over the world working and interact though guests. This place makes us to feel like we are in our friend\\'s homes. I want to come back to this magical place.        \"\\n Considering the entire experience, it is different from any other and a very pleasant one! Nice service, the dishes are prepared with ingredients which we are not used to in our daily life\\'s.     Fantastic décor!  Expensive     \\n Areas do Seixo is a magical place. The restaurant makes part of it, but it is not the best one. To experience in a special occasion. Very nice service.            \\n     My co-workers loved this place and its service! Congratulations! Next time it will be really hard to find a place that could overcome this one!! Some of them even ask if they decide to go on a personal weekend you could make a special price. One more time a big thank!        \\n Food very original and genuine, healthy and tasteful.   I recommend the spa for the quality of its treatments. Unique hotel, with a unexpected location, across the dunes and the sea. An extreme well-tasted place, relax service and well personalized, bold design, fitting perfectly in the nature. Very spacious rooms, with a cozy décor and dreamful bathrooms. A magnify place to be in a romantic environment, with details full of charm. It was a magical stay, very special. To come back one day.        \\n In the restaurant, the tasting menu takes us to the garden, considering the flavors that Chef Leonardo and his team prepare us.    A perfect combination, considering relax, pleasure, beauty and gastronomy, in a fantastic atmosphere. Cozy, and with cold it feels very nice a couple of tea and watch the sea across the fireplace.        \\n\"     Dear Areas do Seixo team: we have no words to describe the wonderful place, magically decorated and the nicest customer service - I guess we dare say, a \\'family-type\\' service, since all of you welcomed us as greatly as possible, in such a warm and elegant style.\\nWe hope that this project and team continue to grow, but always keeping the warmth that only a boutique and charming hotel like this can offer.\\nThank you very much for a memorable stay, please accept our most sincere greetings       \"\\n      Everything good. To repeat one day, for sure. And also recommend.        \\n\"     The hotel is in its whole a fantastic experience. Beautiful architecture, interior décor absolutely fascinating, full of little details standing for difference. The staff is extremely nice and with excellent skills in guests communication (police, nice and discrete). With any doubts an experience to repeat. \\nLast note, we loved the cinema room. Excellent film selection and excellent idea.   One think not as good, it was the restaurant. It took too long to the order to arrive (the employee come to apologize constantly), the monkfish come already cold and the quality/price relation is a bit unbalanced.     Starting by the best parts, the noise in Jasmin room. The fire place was all night making noises making it hard to sleep. If when we have put pillows to avoid the sound. We took several house to fall asleep, and didn\\'t rest properly. We have just slept 3 hours and just after the wind noise go away. After that we were awake for the employees with the breakfast to the next room.\\nThe doors don\\'t isolate the sound as they should, we have heard the employees to  whisper. The next time I consider to make a reservation I will demand a quiet room ( with shame because the room is gorgeous).\"\\n The restaurant is excellent, nice food.    Beautiful, romantic, nice\\x85A nice experience, highly recommended. The staff is very nice. The room Neha Crotchet is wonderful, with a fireplace to warm in the coldest nights, as we went in January. Cozy and with a nice décor. To repeat.        \\n     After a long wait (my reservation was done back in September), we couldn\\'t have a better experience... from lye moment we walked in to lye moment we left, I can only remember joy, smiles, serenity, beauty, beautiful architecture, beautiful landscapes, good taste, wonderful and different flavors (what a Chef, what a kitchen)... simply magic! Everyone should have the right, one day, to be served at Areas do Seixo.         \\n     In general, everything  good and worthy, the hotel and its surroundings.        The price just for one night is very high, in my opinion it is not a fair value. It was if we consider 2 nights. I would consider to repeat the experience if the prices fall down. Besides that fact, I don\\'t find any more weaknesses.\\n Enjoyed particularly the dinner. Great chef.    We are grateful  for this stay        \\n     My wife and I want to thank for the way you treat us, not only for the professional work and kindness, but also for the authentic way you did it.  I take the time to great you for the wonderful place you built, for the boldness in doing something really top and different, with quality addressed in every corner...as my opinion in Tripadvisor, one day, at least one day, everyone should have the right to visit and be served in Areas do Seixo. Hope that life allows a see you soon, one day.        \\n\"    I bless for Marta from SPA, one of the best massages I have ever had.

Very nice and welcoming staff. Nice and different concept.   However, In my opinion I think you should change the restaurant food, Portuguese food is so good! We, and also the foreign people,  love Portuguese food! We should show what your country has the best and promote it!     Beds with soft mattress, very bad for people who have back pain. A mini bar or a bottle of water should also be taken into account.\\n     A wonderful experience! We really want to come back.        \\n     Thank you for everything!

I guess the fall between paradise at areias do seixo and the crap hotel we ended up was a nightmare !!!! So finally, we managed to finalize our fantastic holiday like that !!\\nOUR stay at Areas do Seixo, was MAGICAL, thank you for making all this happen !! I feel like I had a honeymoon, before having it for real !!!! A honeymoon with nature, food, architecture, people... everything !!!!\\nwe look forward to come again !!!        \"\\n\"        \\nLast Sunday we were a group of three people to have lunch at your restaurant, in which we have chosen the tasting menu. The meat dish served was a partridge with celery puree, and sure that the kitchen team will recall, one of the dishes was sent back because the partridge\\'s breast was blood, had not been cooked properly. It turns out that in my case also happened the same, with the partridge breast arrived at the table quite rare and  including raw in the center. For my stupidity I decided not to speak too, and even (through ignorance, I confess) thought it might be that even the intention of the chef, similar to what happens with the pigeon breast, which should be served rare. At a bad time I did, because since yesterday that I meet food poisoning by salmonella strong enough. The purpose of my contact is passing this information to the kitchen and especially the Chef Leonardo Pereira. The balance of the meal was very positive, but was stained by this incident. Mistakes happen to everyone, but I think in this case it was serious, the consequences that happened (I am unable to work since yesterday, that being the owner of a small restaurant, brings a lot of problems), and the fact that in matters of food security should be redoubled. I have no intention to harm a project that I consider having much merit, because the wanted to do had done this \"\"complaint\"\" on social networks rather than do hereby.     \"\\n\" We were 3 and we all ordered the Tasting Menu. The menu was excellent, and Chef Leonard has to be congregated.       \\nLast Sunday I went with some friends to have lunch at your hotel restaurant.\\nUnfortunately, the same can not be said of your waitress. After we ordered the tasting menu, I asked him if there was (apart from the choices of the letter), any proposal for the Food Pairing menu. He told me that yes, that was a proposal tailored to each menu (since vary with some frequency), among whites, reds and dessert. When I asked what the price per person of this option, informed me that would be \\x80 25 (per person).\\nWe were served several wines by the glass during the meal (2 white, 2 red and 1 dessert). The Food Pairing went better in some than in other dishes, and we had the opportunity to discuss with the waitress how challenging some of the dishes were.\\nSo far so good.\\nThe problem, and it\\'s always unfortunate when this happens, when we emerged shows the account (you can see a picture of it attached). Instead of the expected \\x80 75 wine (\\x80 25 x 3), which after all we were charged were 12 glasses of wine, as if they had been ordered à la carte separately. Now was not that any of this was the \"\"sold out\"\", having a considerably higher cost (\\x80 114 vs. \\x80 75).\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t a weekend nice meal, and always mark the experience we had. Given the hotel operation level, I do not think such situations are acceptable.     \"\\n\"     \\nI am delighted with you!\\nI want to thank the whole attention and kindness during my stay at Areas do Seixo. I really enjoyed the hotel and the service. It is splendid!\\nIt really is an experience that everyone should have! I ask you to communicate to the marketing department who loved to receive the offers by email. I have communicate to my team an intention to recommend whenever possible!\\nHoping to continue this good relationship I say goodbye with high regard!        \"\\n\" Very healthy and cutting edge restaurant    \\nVery special hotel in a unique environment, in front of a splendid beach used for surfing area. Environmental friendly, with a very original design, using recycled materials, with its own organic garden.        \"\\n     Picture a place where besides an amazing décor also have a restaurant, to envy any other, multiple for 10! This is Areas do Seixo! Since the architecture of the fireplace till the huge skylights in the room, which brings maximum comfort.          \\n     We\\'ve been in this hotel a few weeks ago and it was an amazing experience! The room, the surroundings full of nature, bossa nova session in the garden, pampering with cookies home made...it was great!        \\n The breakfast on the opposite was great.       Of course this is a personal matter, but in the restaurant it wasn\\'t diversity considering the dishes offered, and the dishes were very  alternative. Miguel ate matured meat and the meat was tough, failed to finish the dish.     \\n     We had a fantastic stay at Areas do Seixo. You have a very wonderful hotel with a great environment, delicious food and amazing rooms. The whole nature environment is also a very calm and beautiful experience.     The only thing that definitely needs to be improved is the extremely slow Wi-Fi. Some website never loads and that became a very stressful situation and I think totally unnecessary. Today you expect it to just work fine. The small Navio restaurant even had a better connection and I understood when I was able to use one of the computers in the reception that you also had another faster connection.   \\n\" \\nYesterday I drive to the restaurant \"\"Areas do Seixo\"\" to enjoy the peace and praised the quality of the environment and flavors.\\nHowever, I had not made a reservation, while browsing the site (after reading the Evasões magazine about the reopening), I did not get the idea that it was necessary.\\nRegards the chef Leonardo Pereira authorized an exception and we could have lunch.\\nThere are no words to express the gratitude for the kindness.\\nAnd then it was a memorable dining experience ... Since the care and education of employees, the combination of flavors, the friendliness of the chef Leonardo Pereira. Who kindly presented us with a surprise dessert.\\nIt is with great appreciation that mean that approx trip. 700km worth of all the wonderful experience.\\nIn this regard, I must complement all the elements of your team.            \"\\n     We posted a review on tripadvisor.  We had a great stay and absolutely loved the place.  Thank you to the whole staff for treating us so well.  Everybody was fantastic to us.  On our way home to NYC we spoke with an English couple about your hotel and they were already looking it up and planning when they can go!  Obrigado        \\n     Congratulations to Areas do Seixo, which is better and beautiful every time. I\\'ve made my wife\\'s 50th birthday party here and it was one of the best and beautiful parties I have ever attended.        \\n\"             Your policy against children make me choose for children.\\nYou are gay-friendly, anti-bullfighting friendly, zen-friendly, trendy-friendly friendly smoking, I regret that children are to you and to the guests such a nuisance! Children are not aliens, they are of this world and have the same right to enjoy and attend the same places, it is regrettable that they are such a nuisance when I spent 40 years of my life to passively endure the smoke and the addiction of others in public places, it is doubly unfortunate because we are a country with the world\\'s smallest birth rate, but that does not respect the children.\"\\n\"     We would like to congratulate you and all of your team for this perfect break we get.\\nHope to come back as soon as possible\\n        \"\\n\"             I have contacted your unit since I\\'ve made the reservation through Booking, selecting for this purpose the option of 2 adults and 1 child from 0 years, whereby it was presented to me the result of the quarter for which I made the reservation.\\nAlso in the Booking and additional information of the room in question, state that \"\"children as young as 10 years are welcome\"\" with a \"\"rate of 80 \\x80\"\" and birthplace of placement \"\"subject to availability\"\"\\nOnce children as young as 10 years do not sleep in the cradle and I was allowed to make the booking to the end, the conclusion reached is that children under 10 years do not pay fee of 80 \\x80 but the cradle can not this ensured (situation is not raise me any problems since it could lead to my child travel bed).\\nTo my amazement after the reservation indicating to the credit card data received the information below, which is not realized. Then I went on your website and later called:\\nI do not see anywhere reference in your site a ban on children under the age of 10 years in the rooms.\\nThe reference in the Booking children from the age of 10 are welcome means that those who had lower age are not welcome?\\nThe telephone clarification they gave me does not allow children under 10 years in the room not to disturb the rest of the other guests as the hotel\\'s concept is relaxation. But alternatively suggested to me one of the Villas with the minimum total amount is around \\x80 600.\\nWe were therefore faced with a prejudice against age and, worse still, given the price disparity, we face discrimination, since the price of the reservation of the Villas is double the price.\\n Also not mentioning this explicitly discrimination anywhere on your site or on Booking and allow reserves to be completed only after informing the discriminatory policy and your present alternatively a different type of accommodation that is not only different as costs double , is not an alternative.\\nSo that\\'s why I feel angry and cheated by you, I ask response to this complaint by the same way I inform you that I will submit complaint with regulatory authorities Tourism.\"\\n\" The food was good also if I ate only salad the whole 3 days, but I couldn\\'t get enough of it. Yesterday I had two because yesterday they were a bit smaller than normally, but it was okay. The garlic bread that I ordered and which was not on the list was more than perfect, you should add it definitely to your menu list! I think guests would like it! Well, maybe also not, if only one of the couples wants to eat the garlic bread ;-)! But it was perfect! BREAKFAST: - perfect! I found everything what I wanted, I missed only the Latte Macchiato ;-) I ordered it twice but got two different things to drink in the morning. Once I got a macchiato and once a cappuccino. But that was fine too!\\nOne minus-point: The coffees are just way too hot! (I\\'m Italian and we drink lots of coffee... and your coffee is definitely served too hot!! Try it ;-))\\nEverybody was nice. But Felipe and Sergio (i guess the names are right) are two perfect bartenders! Felipe\\'s flirty and chatty art is far away to top in the restaurant! We enjoyed it when he served us!    SPA: Massage: Heaven!!!! Wow! So sorry that we didn\\'t see Tine this morning. She was perfect! We enjoyed every minute and every detail in your hotel. The rooms are superb, the decoration is heavenly in every part of the hotel, compliments. I think, besides the people, the decoration and the interior design is the most important thing here and its perfect! I came for that  and I found all that what I wanted to see -  not only in the pictures of the website! Which doesn\\'t happen all the time in hotels!   One of the girls in the restaurant sometimes seemed to have a bad day. Not all the time, but sometimes we thought that she didn\\'t really wanted to work right now.     PEDI/MANICURE: Not worth the money! I do get lots of mani/pedis in Hotels but this one was definitely not worth the money. But I should have said STOP immediately when I saw the women entering the room because I looked at her nails (which were kind of eaten and than at her feet - some with naipolish, some without some with a bit of it still on it)... The women, I forgot her name, was really nice and friendly but the treatment was not perfect at all. The color was on my skin besides the nails of my fingers and on the feet she didn\\'t take away dead skin, and, the bit what she did was only with the \"\"razor-thing\"\" (which of course is quicker...)  and not with the normal products that everybody is used too.  You should think about getting another one to do that. It is not professional at all! \"\\n     One of the charming hotels I have ever met.        \\n     We had a wonderful honeymoon and the stay here!

Remarkably, we wish come back anytime, that\\'s why our conclusion can only be: a big thumbs up ! I enjoyed particularly  the relaxed atmosphere and hassle free! Luxury and no tie dinner, we like that! The path to the beach is also an experience, such as the beach itself! The room was simply to feel good! The spa area was tastefully decorated, we enjoyed the steam room and massage treatments.        \"\\n     Fantastic service, wonderful décor, very cozy hotel, adorable food.

In the future we\\'ll certainly stay longer. \\nThe location and grounds were perfect, the rooms even better and finally the staff still beating both of those. \\nThe restaurant opened us to new foods and ways to present them. The drinks were fantastic and the beach was beautiful. The walk from the hotel to the ocean was through dunes with colorful vegetation ending with a tremendous view of the waves.\\nWe hope to make it a regular place to stay in the future.        \"\\n\"     \\nA totally different place, a real calm bubble. Hotel characterized as full of design, mineral and vegetable. Our room on the ground floor, overlooking the sea was very spacious with an amazing bathroom with fireplace and olive. We found this very environmental friendly place.        \"\\n    Amazing SPA in all ways        The hotel is located practically in a meadow of flowers that culminates in a stunning series of sand dunes. The rooms are big and bright: they managed to give the idea of ??being outdoors. Our room had an outdoor hot tub and that was finely decorated. The outline level absolutely nothing to say. However, we feel that the problem is that the prices are exorbitant compared to a staff that seems not to notice. It was a gift for our honeymoon (which informed the reception and they were totally unnoticed). For 350 euros per night can not cut grass in front of midday room at six o\\'clock. Also I don\\'t  want to have a receptionist who treats me as her best friend, when she is not. With few exceptions, of course, but the staff (employee restaurant to the cleaners who were playing loudly as if in a desert) have confused the warmth and availability with lack of professionalism: the hotel still travels to order hundreds of euros per room. We were in a hotel that cost a quarter of this, but on a personal level they were unique. \\n     An absolutely magic stay in this unique place. All surroundings, every single details, unique smells, the kindness\\x85Thank you for making a special night became unique.        \\n\"     Dear all, \\nWe really enjoyed our stay and like to come back very soon!!!        \"\\n\"     My husband and I had an AMAZING time at your hotel on our honeymoon. Every detail was perfect! The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, the staff was fabulous, and the food was simply amazing! We ate at the restaurant all three nights we stayed at the hotel and could not get over how delicious everything was! And the fact that the menu changed every day was just icing on the cake. \\nOur hotel room was stunning, and our private patio was so relaxing. Having a view of the gardens, the sand dunes, and the ocean all at once was magical. We had the most relaxing stay and cannot wait to return!         \"\\n\"     Last Thursday we\\x92ve stayed in Areas do Seixo and our stay has truly been amazing. We were impressed by the beauty of the hotel and kindness of all your employees. Together with the incredible nature and ecological environment, the experience was complete. Being in Areas do Seixo was an incredible experience and herewith we\\x92d like to thank all of you for making our trip even more unforgettable. Please, do not see this as negative, because we really, really enjoyed staying in your hotel. These were just the points that we thought might be improved to create an even better experience for other guests.\\nThanks again so much, it has been amazing.   In our opinion the menu for dinner was quite limited. We know the concept it\\x92s based on the products in the garden (which we really like!), but we can imagine for some guests the choice might be too limited. The jacuzzi was dirty when we got in, which might be blamed on the fact that there wasn\\x92t a roof above the place where the tub was situated. We stayed in Oliviera Princesa and it seemed to be the only room without a roof / roofwindow above this area.     We missed a garbage bin in the hotel room. There was only 1 (tiny) bin in the toilet, and we missed a garbage bin in the sleeping area. \"\\n\" The restaurant, the place yesterday evening was so gorgeous.

Congratulations to owners and employees.        \\n     We really enjoyed: the relaxed atmosphere, the beautiful architecture, the nature around and the amazing beach, the double shower, that everything isn\\'t that touristic here, the authentic dinner in the wine cellar and of course the very friendly service (specially Joana S and Kiki) thank you   For the future and our next stay we hope to find some more vegan food options     \\n     Wonderful stay, rooms are incredible, staff very friendly, food excellent. Area is very nice specially for watersports. Hope to come back soon. Ps: room 1 is wonderful        \\n\" The restaurant, either for breakfast or dinner is from an unusual quality. The breakfast  schedule is something more hotels would adopt because it makes perfect sense. In addition, the fact that someone who prepares the eggs and bacon on request is stupendous. As for dining service, there are no words. I confess that I was very curious because Chef Leonardo Pereira expectations were not completely dashed. It should be noted the courage to have an open kitchen to the living room where you do not hear anything and that everything works almost like an orchestra. Spectacular!   As for the spa, the Moroccan theme is quite interesting. The quality of the massage and sympathy of both masseurs was quite high and I will repeat as soon as possible. \\nHaving no account on TripAdvisor, I decided to email my experience with my wife.\\nStarting with the staff, only words of gratitude. Despite being a charming, 5-star hotel, the staff strives for sympathy and the unpretentious which in our view only promotes and elevates the hotel to another level. I have to thank all team.\\nThe room, the sea, is stupendous. It has almost endless views and waking up to a view like that is almost one of the best pleasures in the world. In addition, the treats left in the room as those salty squares (DIVINAL!) And cookies elevate their quality. Attention to detail, such as the lighting of candles in the evening was also to our liking.\\nI just feel sad because the time have been little hot to be able to sunbathing by the pool, but of course that there is nothing they could have done to improve. I can only wish that everything continues to go well and you to keep your quality and sympathy, because in the end, that\\'s what makes the difference.\"\\n\"            Good morning, I would like to share my experience with you. Despite the natural beauty where the hotel belongs, I was quite disappointed with the service in general. First , I came to spend my anniversary and no one had the attention to wish me congratulations, by mail I had been suggested different packs and I had not any. Personal  not very sympathetic and our room \"\"Terra\"\" two nights only once was ready for bed. Cleaning generally leaves to be desired ... the end not felt well and I will not recommend. \"\\n\" Your restaurant and bar service is absolutely top    Following  your suggestion .... here is my review:\\nI checked-in in your hotel on 21  and checked-out on 22 June.\\nWe marvel at your concept, the mix and balance between nature; the cement and the predominant material in the décor (wood), is exceptional.\\nVery cute and nice.\\nVery well equipped .... not having felt any lack.\\nRegarding the employees: Friends, from the receptionist; bar service; restaurant service; kitchen service, informality (in the form of being and dressing) and proximity to the customer is anything that makes us feel at home family.\\nI really enjoyed the \"\"Joanas\"\", Sérgio Filipe, Gilberto Lucas (Great \"\"Chef\"\") Carina (inexhaustible power) and not forgetting that for these faces to shine there is always an entire \"\"staff\"\" that makes it appear to be very easy keep an entire structure, working properly oiled.\\nA big Thanks to all and I assure outset that I will (I have done on Facebook) heartily recommend to all friends; acquaintances and clients to lodge in my local area located in St. Benedict / Chiado.\\nBest of luck the \"\"Sands of Pebble\"\"        \"\\n     We loved the room, the environment, food. People are very nice.        Not so good would enhance the pool area. A day that are more than 5 couples in the pool (and should happen often) there is no room / bed for all.  I think it could be improved a bit this aspect. However, I tried to talk to Yiulyia namely the possibility of organizing a party in Areas do Seixo and they can not receive me, and despite having already sent an email 3 days ago also did not have any answer. I think we can improve this point as well.\\n\"     I will if you give me your sourdough recipe!!!\\nHonestly, your hotel is absolutely amazing and I will go onto tripadvisor. When we came 2 years ago the food was the only let down but it is truly spectacular now.  But really well done, just incredible.\\nWe will be back. The only thing we could find complaint with, if you do want feedback and this is tiny but your cutlery is very uncomfortable to hold!!\"\\n\"Dear  Daniella. Just back home after a very nice roundtrip in north and central Portugal.   We specially want to thank you for our  fantastic stay in your hotel.  \\nNext time we really hope to stay longer in Santa Cruz beach.\\nWe appreciate the perfect reception upon our arrival and also your kindly and lovely smile!\\nAfter travelling the world round  finally we discovered that  heaven  exist ( but only )  on earth and in Portugal haha \\nThe hotel was really   \\x93 un havre de paix \\x93    and a  paradise.  \\nBe sure that we will inform our colleagues specialized  in \\x93  Vip Travel \\x93   in Belgium. Once again 1000 x thanks.\"\\n     You have asked for our feedback on our stay (one night on June 18). We found your hotel excellent and everything was impeccable. Our only concern is that there\\'s not much in the area, but if one wants to relax this is the ideal place. Well done!! We love the decoration.        \\n\"     I hereby give my opinion regarding our day stay June 21, 2015.\\nThere was a month ago chose the Areias do Seixo to spend our first honeymoon night and nothing could have been better. It was really magical. You do have a place where time stands still, where the beauty is unparalleled. And we always thought about going back and so was.\\n        A year later we returned to celebrate that date and we faced an extremely unpleasant situation. When we met in the tub all was well until we turn the jacuzzi and immediately came a nauseating smell and we had to get out of the tub immediately. Baffled by the situation we were watching the water and this was in full of green slime coming out of air vents through which the bubbles are formed. Later when we passed by the reception we reported the event to the employee very gently and shocked by what she had told asked immense apology.\\nIn conclusion meant that incidents do happen although this shows a lack of care by the maintenance of the resort. As described on booking.com: \"\"Get the celebrity treatment with world-class service at Areas Do Seixo Charm Hotel & Residences\"\". With this it creates a great expectation treatment. And so we were surprised with the result of our complaint was only an apology. Like any other couple travel a lot and already we passed many hotels and in the middle of so many positive experiences from time to time happen less pleasant situations but has always given us an apology followed by attention to the client. Thing not obtained by the Areias do Seixo and which left us a bit disappointed.\\nWith regard to your request to share our experience with the tripadvisor consider doing it before but we wanted to give you our feedback.\"\\n\"     I would like to thank you so much for everything.\\nLast weekend my parents celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary in your hotel.\\nThey told me, it was fantastic and the best gift ever, from my sisters and I.\\nSo thanks a lot.        \"\\n\"     I can not think of a great idea for a text that describes you faithfully words occur;\\n wonder\\n dazzled\\n Blown away by the taste.\\n A fabulous retreat that I really want to go back and will never forget.        \"\\n\"     As requested, this is just a short email with some feedback on our stay.\\n\\nOverall we loved our visit to Areas do Seixo and definitely plan to return. The location is wonderful, the accommodation superb and the service was excellent. Many thanks to all of the staff who made our visit so enjoyable.\\nOverall though, as I say, we loved our stay and definitely plan to return in future.\\n   In terms of constructive feedback, the only other comment I would make is that we found the evening meals dragged on too long. We stayed for three evenings and found we were left waiting for our food too long during the evenings of Sunday 5th and Tuesday 7th July. The restaurant was extremely busy on each evening. The waiters appeared to be focused on other tables and we were not afforded the opportunity to order additional drinks in between courses. On the evening of Tuesday 7th July, I also had to help myself to cutlery for dessert. We really enjoyed the food which was of an extremely high quality and stood out for its freshness, but it struck me that on each evening the kitchen was a little overwhelmed. In terms of addressing this, I wonder if it might help to remove the tasting menu - it seemed that this proved too much of a distraction and overwhelmed the kitchen with knock-on effects for other diners.     \"\\n\"     Thank You Joana, \\nI had a wonderful stay at the hotel (I didn\\'t want to leave). \\nHere are few pictures that I took         \"\\n\"     Dear Areas do Seixo,\\nMy husband and I stayed with you in the 7 Sentidos room on 15 June. We had such a lovely time! We loved everything, from the room, the facilities, the food, the friendly staff to your spa treatments. We had a fantastic experience. We are looking forward to coming back for another visit next year, but for longer next time. \\nIn the room, we especially loved the mix of relaxing music that you played through your sound system. We enjoyed it so much we are wondering if you sell a CD of your music or if you know where we can buy your playlist from and what it\\'s called, please?\\n\\nThanks again for looking after us so well.         \"\\nAs has always been a pleasure travel to your hotel, and of course to see you again !!!!, Your service, hotel and  guests treatment, is a great example! I wish you luck in the future and already looking forward to come back! \\n\"     We had a wonderful stay at Areas do Seixo and we loved the decoration, the atmosphere, the amenities and the food.        \\x95 Our mattress was relatively old and had a curved shape, which made the sleep uncomfortable;\\n\\x95 The extra-beds for the kids were making noise at every move, which also disrupted our sleep;\\n\\x95 The price charged for such extra-beds was completely outrageous (\\x80 160.- !).\"\\n\"     We had a marvelous stay at Areas do seixo. Everything was great. We were welcomed by a drink with pie, then drive to our room \"\"Oliveira Princesa\"\" : a wonderful bathroom with 2 showers, a jacuzzi, .....\\nThe room is large, beautiful with a very nice view on the garden, the dunes and the sea.\\nThere is everything you need: 2 hats, a basket,an ombrelle to go to the sea, not far( 15 minutes  walk). The beach is great, not much people, a rescue team, waves, sand.\\nIn the evening, before going to the restaurant, you can take a glass of wine ( offers ) near a fire, outside. It is really magical!\\nThe restaurant is very good and breakfast great.\\nSo this was a really wonderful stay, everything was done to that, and the staff was really kind and nice.\\nIt was difficult to leave after 3 days there, but I hope we will come again.\\nThank you to all that made this place so great.        \"\\n\" Dear two Joanna\\'s :-), Sergio, Carina, Maria and Philip  \\nHow are you? We had a safe trip back home but we miss you and your lovely place very much. As we promised you find in the attachment two pictures of the paintings we bought of our \"\"home\"\" woman-artist. We are so happy with them and they fit into our apartments perfectly!:-)\\nWe want to say a hearty thank you again for your kindness, your cordiality and for your excellent service! We will definitely come back soon and perhaps even for our marriage;-) We saw the beautiful scenery you made for the American couple and that really left us speechless.\\nLovely greetings from us and please keep in touch!        \"\\n\"     \\nThe expectation was high as compared to existing assessments. We found a great hotel: beautiful, well decorated and very comfortable.     However, objectifying the consolidation of excellence, we think it will be to review the cleaning some glasses of the Restaurant.   \"\\n\" \\n\\nI just heard on Antena 1 wonders of your kitchen, I intend one day to visit, I need more information about the location.\\nI was delighted with what I heard on the different plants used for you.\\nCongratulations to your team and management, it would be good to spread to more areas of the country.            \"\\n\" Also, the staff in the restaurant (floor and chefs) , out of this world. As someone who has close connections with the hospitality industry, we were absolutely blown-away with the dining experience.     We had a fantastic stay. We have reviewed (5 stars) on TripAdvisor, it should be up in the coming days under the user name, Mattje7.\\nOne thing we were a bit surprised by (not mentioned in the TripAdvisor review) is the nightclub next to the property.  There was no air conditioner in the rooms, it was hot, we tried to have the door looking out to the garden open but had two problems (1) mosquitos and (2) the \"\"duff duff\"\" base from the club next door. As I am sure you are aware (because the hotel staff were) it goes till 9am on a Sunday morning. Not very relaxing or picturesque. \\nNot sure there is anything you can do about this issue going forward, just thought would bring it to your attention. \\n Best to you and the hotel\\n        \"\\n     We have just spent the most wonderful twelve days at areias. The hotel, ambience and staff  were outstanding a truly special place.  Magical and unique we can\\'t wait to come back.         \\n\" Ola Leonardo,\\nWe have just returned from our holidays in Portugal.\\nWe want to thank you again very much for the great dinner we have had at Areas do Seixo!\\nWhat you and your team are doing is simply fantastic.\\nIt was one of the best meals we have ever had!\\nAnd Leonardo, we have seen a lot.\\nSeeing you and your team at work in the open kitchen was an inspiring sight.\\nI am very enthusiastic about how you bring innovation to the Portuguese cuisine.\\nLight and easily digestible, surprising and full of flavor. \\nI was simply blown away by your cooking and I wanted it to let you know that.\\nWe are looking forward visiting you again soon!            \"\\n\"We spend nice moment to Areas do seixo.\\nWe were for about 12 days on villa 2.\\nWe found really nice:\\n- The hotel and the garden, specially the vegetable garden.\\n- The walk to go to the beach and the beautiful beach.\\n- The team is really friendly, also the cook and the cleaning ladies .\\n- The delicious breakfast, the wonderful salads and sandwiches at lunch and also the fantastic diner.Anyway, we keep a really nice memory of our stay by you.

We will certainly be back.        \\n\"       I email you secretly from the \"\"7 senses\"\" room, since I booked this hotel as a surprise for my new husband. We got married 2 days ago in Amsterdam and are here on our honeymoon as I emailed with you repeatedly (I also spoke on the phone several times with the reception desk). \\nI am a little bit disappointed since until now I don\\'t have the feeling that we are on our honeymoon and I would really like a little surprise for my husband (just a note or sign would be great) to remind us of our honeymoon (as we discussed on the phone, maybe I should have contacted you just before the weekend, but I did trust that my request was noted by you).\\nYou think it is still possible, a little late but just a small sign that we are just married, that\\'s why I booked with you guys :) you looked like a real honeymoon hotel.      \"\\n\"     Some news as promised. My wife was at the Cuf Infanto Santu hospital until Thursday 6/08. She finally had an myocarditis, which is less than an infarct, but still important.\\nWe came back to Belgium Saturday 8/08. Now she has to recover and see a lot of doctors again !\\nWe would like to thank you a lot for your help and kindness in our difficult moment. Areas do Seixo is a fantastic place even it\\'s there that happens the problem of my wife.\\nIt\\'s a virus caused by her gastroenteritis which went to her heard and was making big trouble.\\nThe welcome of the hotel, the place, the philosophy, the food, everything is perfect in Areas do Seixo.        \"\\n\" Breakfast: The choices were wonderful and it was like being in someone\\x92s kitchen helping ourselves to food.\\nDinner: We had tasting menu. All dishes were so creative and tasty. We also like the way each chef serving their own dishes to tables rather than waiters going back and forth the kitchen and floor. It added to the taste that we could see the chefs cooking in their open kitchen.     We are writing to give you our feedback on our stay at your hotel.\\nWe stayed in one of your villas facing the sea for 4 nights.\\nIt was our first time to Portugal and we can\\x92t tell you enough how amazing the whole trip was.\\nWe always travel all over Asia, Europe and USA every year based in London and we can confidently say this was one of the best experiences we\\x92ve had.\\nStaff (receptionist, kitchen staff, waiters, waitresses, house keepers): All so extremely personal, friendly, smiley and helpful.\\nVilla: The design was at its best and the cleanness of the villa was second to none. Towels were all soft as new and the bedlinen was so white and crisp with homely duvet.\\nThe design of the villa was practical and beautiful. The decorating style was so inspirational. We loved using the well equipped kitchen with bbq facility outside. The kitchen was all immaculate, didn\\x92t have any trace of other people who stayed and used the facility.\\nGarden: It was natural and loved the veg garden. We bumped into one of the staff who was picking vegetables for the kitchen and she kindly offered us some herbs for our bbq and even sent someone to our villa to give us a box of garden vegetables. We were so grateful and happy.\\n When we went back to our villa after dinner, our beds were turned beautifully, candles were lit everywhere.\\nWe can not wait to go back to the hotel again and we do hope the quality of things we mention above will be kept well.\\nWe thank you so much for looking after us so well and we are grateful for the sweetest memories you gave us.\\nLook forward to seeing you again.        \"\\n\"     We enjoyed our honeymoon in Areas do Seixo  lot. Location, architecture and decoration are fantastically beautiful. Breakfast and dinner were perfect. ( Would it be possible to get the recipe for the caramelized white chocolate and the cauliflower & olives ?)\\nThe staff was very friendly and engaging.\\nTwo tiny suggestions.  No complaint \\x96 just help for grow.\\nPlease excuse my bad English , I hope it will be better up to our next visit.\\n  A little bit more professionalism at the front desk would be desirable. For example, booking a rental car should be possible without difficulty. If you spend several days at the hotel the menu repeats. It would be nice, if the choice would be expanded slightly, or the guests would be noted.     \"\\n\"     Stayed 2 nights. Somewhat a strange place with all luxury amenities you would like combined with the hippie dressed staff who all seem like they are slightly high, yet they are very professional and helpful. \\nWe booked late and did not get a room with a nice view, but with a secluded small garden and an amazing outdoor shower. Bed was soft and comfortable and with a proper duvet. A wonderful beach is a short walk away and this part of the Portuguese coast is amazing for surfing. Pool and hotel grounds are amazing. Breakfast had a lot choices and dinner was also excellent. Would definitely come back.        \"\\n\"     Filled with tasteful, small details and sophisticated elegance, Hotel Areas do Seixo was an amazing discovery. An absolutely inspiring place where just a fantastic room for a window size than we can see and found a blue sea by front of us !!\\n Delicate and super staff available.\\n Price above average, but a UNIQUE experience !!!\\n We liked.        \"\\n\"             Having heard about this hotel we drove one hour from Lisbon to check for ourselves!\\nOn our arrival, and before my husband had got out of the car an employee called from the door and asked if we needed help.\\nI replied that we would need advice, when my husband was able to discuss.\\nThe said employee seemed reluctant either to offer us any information or to let us into the hotel. Finally inside she said that we could not look round the hotel and pool as they had,\"\"A Group\"\".\\nWhen I then asked to see a menu she told me that the menu was so many courses at such a price.\\nThe result therefore of our journey to evaluate the hotel was zero.\\nFor my next visit to a top star hotel, in September, I shall avoid this one and shall go to one where I receive a gracious welcome.\"\\n     We have seen and experienced many hotels but what the Areas do Seixo offers surpasses everything. An incredibly exciting, exciting and wonderful place. An architecture and interiors which the guest can not rest and this I mean the positive sense. There is always something new to discover. One can place in different corners and amazed. The team is open, friendly, warm, knowledgeable, funny, erected, restrained and makes the hotel what it is. A DREAM! The restaurant is maybe for some guests specifically but it has its own style and fits finally to the hotel. The quality is excellent! The rooms are amazing and yes, enter the 1st time remains open mouth. The size and the architecture of the room and the bathroom are impressive. We will definitely recommend the hotel and would definitely come again. THANK YOU FOR THE DREAM   Ok, it is rather expensive and the selection rather modest but the hotel itself makes up all this.      \\n\"     Pro:\\nOur gold room\\nBeautiful beach nearby \\nSwimming pool \\nDesigner interiors\\nDelicious breakfast - homemade bread and local products  We had to carry our heavy luggages from the bus stop (2km to the hotel ). We called the reception but no one could help us ordering a taxi or shuttle.  Some staff were not nice - like the bold guon in the restaurant.     \"\\n\"     5 th visit and still the very best of Portugal.\\nJust spent 5 nights in the most perfect room which I can\\'t pronounce.\\nReturning next week for another three nights.\\nThe wonderful people behind the bar in the restaurant and at reception have become our very good friends, nothing is too much trouble and the attention to detail is fantastic.\\nMany will try and imitate this spectacular Eco hotel but as we have found all of them have fallen short.\\nThe new beach bar called Noah just a 20 minute stroll down the beach is a wonderful addition to an already perfect place.\\nKeep up the great work guys you can\\'t keep us away!\\nLove to you all.        \"\\n\"     Areas do Seixo is truly special and you will realize it in every little aspect from the moment you enter.\\nThe architecture of the whole resort is modern yet personal and functional. Every little corner is designed with much love and attention to detail. The lighting at night provides a nice romantic atmosphere. \\nOur room (#5) was very spacious with a big bath tub, a great chimney and an open bath room as the main highlights. The hotel\\'s own music channel is also worth mentioning, it provided constant high quality relaxation tunes. We also liked the terrace with loungers which was open to the garden yet providing enough privacy.\\nThe service was second to none. You could really tell that each employee is proud to work there and genuinely friendly and welcoming. \\nWe would definitely recommend the experiences they offer. The bonfire with music and wine was very enjoyable. We also did the tea experience in which you can create your own tea from their garden. Renting bikes is also a good idea to explore the fantastic wild dunes and beaches. And all three options were for free!\\nThe breakfast has a big variety of very fresh food. If you don\\'t find meat on the buffet, just order it.   Dinner is maybe the only reason for some small criticism. While the daily menu (3 starters and 3 mains plus a tasting menu) is always very inventive and made of the freshest organic ingredients, it can get at times a bit too eclectic and sophisticated. Why not just adding a few classic dishes to the menu if one feels less fancy? After having spoken with other guests this limited choice seems also to be a concern for families with kids.\\nThe solution to this (small) issue is to drive 5min to Noah, a fantastic brand new beach house in Santa Cruz. They do amazingly fresh fish and seafood dishes at reasonable prices. Furthermore it is a great place to chill at the beach or to learn surfing.     \"\\n     Was blown away by our stay! Stayed 2 nights. Staff and service were incredible. They took care of our every need. Food and drinks were amazing! Everything from the coffee to the salads grown right on the property were excellent. If you want to treat yourself and someone you love to a perfect get away this it.        \\n\" The food is beyond delicious.     This is a slice of paradise. Johanna s Johanna j and Philippe ensure that your stay is just magical. The common areas are gorgeous. Think the chicest coolest commune you\\'ll ever be witness too. The attention to detail form the swings at reception to strategically placed bonfire from which to stargaze to the beautifully appointed furnishings throughout the hotel are too numerous to mention. The Eco sustainability to all the components of the hotel are an added bonus. The chef comes from directly from noma and the food is directly cultivated from their garden of which you can go look and be part of. Then of course there\\'s the location. You arrive at what seems like a seemingly nondescript locale only to be ultimately blown away with what awaits you when entering the doors to the main house. Walk along their path to the sea . Your eyes will constantly be readjusting. \\nRun don\\'t walk to this slice of paradise.        \"\\n  The food was exceptional -- the tasting menu was a treat. Breakfast is amazing.     Areas do Seixo was truly a special place. It seemed that every detail was attended to with great care. The décor and surroundings and location really made it feel relaxing, peaceful and magical. The staff was so friendly, helpful and accommodating -- there wasn\\'t anything they wouldn\\'t do for us -- they made us feel at home.The villa was extremely comfortable and beautifully designed and decorated. The dunes and beach were within a comfortable walking distance and was absolutely beautiful.        \\n\"     \\nI spent one night in this hotel and what an hotel so we came and played the bell to enter :) we are presented with two rocking chairs in the reception where we make a brief check in without big wastes of time, just the essentials. We are invited to have tea with produce grown in Horta Hotel. Magnify!\\nBut when we entered the room and in this case ours was Jasmin went into a transe that wonderful space, huge but very cozy, always with background music, the furniture forget it, all made and designed with many feelings to the mix bet. Everything has a meaning and implicit feeling.\\nThen we were invited to join us at the Fire Circle, where we had a bonfire and several vancos made by trunks where we drank a glass of wine and we get to know the other guests and even employees.\\nThe perfect phrase several times and said the same: \"\"Feel at home\"\" and it was exactly how I felt and loved everything, every detail, so simple and so magnanimous at the same time.\\nNo doubt an experience to repeat and get to a new room!        \"\\n\"     It was the second time that we had the pleasure of staying at Areas do Seixo Hotel.\\nEverything is magical and unique. The integration with the nature is absolute amazing! We are truly passionate with this place! Perfect for relax, enjoy life and feel everything around us. \\nThe small olive room at the first stay was very good but now the Neha cretcheu room is simply amazing. The smell, the music, the jacuzzi are lovely. \\nIf the perfection exists, it is at Areas do Seixo.\\nFrom truly passionate guests.        \"\\n\" The breakfast service is very friendly, and picturesque quality to be served in the kitchen. It gives an interesting transparency and involves guests and staff.    I received a gift night for dating birthday and I must say I was absolutely dazzled. I\\'ve met several hotels, in and out of Portugal, and this went directly to the top of my preferences.\\nImpeccably decorated space, ecological sustainability and environmental strongly emphasized within and surroundings. Informal service but very friendly in general. Hospitable and welcoming: with bit like a slice of homemade cake and a direct tea garden, make my well Recber delights. The decor is sublime. The fireplace invite you to linger is on summer nights, here are never scorching, and at the peak of winter. The rooms and the concept of exclusivity are well achieved, there is a parallel between the two rooms, the bedroom and living area and the bathroom, making it difficult to choose which of the two spend more time. Natural light through the skylight right above the bath tub create a fantastic environment.\\nIn short, all the space in this hotel is decorated with care and engaging. The interior trees, the prevalence of wood, slate and the knowledge that there are written, everything converges in a listed building environment is charming.\\nEverything else, applause.   In my opinion, the only experience that left me disappointed was the restaurant. Since we choose for dinner the tasting menu, did not exceed expectations. In fact, I dare say that in 8 black and 3 desserts no one that would give me a taste experience, a shame that the hotel deserved a walk kitchen, in line with the space. The filing this edge. And, concomitantly, turns out to be unpleasant to the price, exorbitant charged. It would be an even higher price for a sublime tasting, ever fair for what is served. There is an effort by the gourmet and nouvelle cuisine, but does not match. It\\'s worth thinking about it.     \"\\n\"     How can I start to even describe the magic of this place. The building is just breathtaking out of a magazine. Everything here is meant for you to relax and rest. The pool is plain gorgeous. The rooms are incredible with massive bathrooms like you\\'ve never seen. The beach is just steps\\nAway. We had a dream stay        \"\\n\"     After 3 days in the center of Lisbon, we escaped the baking heat and after a hour-long Uber ride arrived here.\\nFirst impressions count and the place is stunning.\\nEvery aspect of the hotel, the productive fields, is presented beautifully. From the concrete walls to the piped music, the hotel oozes quiet confidence - it is the most perfect place to relax.        \"\\n     The most amazing time there. Everything is wonderful and very delicious. Lovely service team. Everyone does their best to give you the best vacation. Bikes can be borrowed free of charge, there are free yoga and wine tasting. It is a friendly feeling of comfort. Totally awesome rooms. The food in the restaurant is delicious and not expensive.         \\n\"     An experience not to be missed, no doubt. The prime location on the seafront; Calm and serenity that sits in the hotel; the friendliness of the staff; the 4th huge, super comfortable, refined decoration. Breakfast is great. We made the Floral Massage and I can say it was the best massage I\\'ve ever done. It\\'s expensive for our bags everyday, but nothing expensive for the quality it offers.        \"\\n     I married here last 4th July. Everything ran smoothly since the day we schedule our big day, all the meetings were important and we felt that our interests were listened. The big day was a dream. All the details were just perfect and even better that I could dream of. Special thanks to all the staff, specially to Yuliya that always helped and advised us in everything she could. The best place if you want to relax and enjoy a beautiful sunset        \\n\" The successive meals we had here alone justify the price of the room. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and it was easily the most welcoming experience we have had recently. Special mention to the three who ran the place during the evening, and the lovely chefs who brought course after course of food they were proud to serve.     Hotel is beautiful, rooms are stunning. The best part of the hotel for us was the restaurant. \\nWould definitely recommend this place for a two night stay.        The only minor critique (1) the rooms do not have air-conditioning and it gets hot. Sleeping with the door open is not really an option as there is no screen to stop the mosquitoes coming in; and (2) we stayed during a very busy period and as such, there was a massive shortage of deck chairs / couches by the pool. Many people were sitting on the grass as a result. This seems like an easy fix given the magnificent space and breath-taking views.\"\\n     Fantastic place. Very relaxing. Lost a years worth of wedding planning stress looking over the Atlantic. Everyone there is truly helpful, from reception, to the bar and waiting staff, they make you feel at home. This is a truly special place, and if you don\\'t mind s little wind we very much recommend.        \\n     Hotel of great originality that can not be ignored: a boho style green in an offset environment. Decorative work of highly sought rooms and staging room before the friendly night (candles, music). Food: very decent breakfast with excellent bread.  However the benefits are not worthy of a 5 *: indifferent reception, waiting for decision-long consumption Meal tasting evening to flee, desire for originality which turns to disaster . Our advice: go back to basics when you can not do the star cuisine. Anyway the overall experience interesting but not for everybody: amateur bohemian atmosphere this is for you, if not go your way. Unwashed ground (feet are black when exiting the shower ), very rough household (cobweb on the terrace).    No air conditioning for not killing the planet.\\n\" We should also note the restaurant is the responsibility of Leonardo Pereira (former Nomad), which is a kitchen inspiration Nordic / Scandinavian and here they cast soil. I had experienced another time the tasting menu, a lunch, but this time we had dinner.    As can be seen in any review and multiple sites, this is in fact a single magic place. Hats off to those who developed the concept and thought the space, along with the decor and service are absolutely fabulous. Everything is thought to make us feel good and relaxed.\\n The staff are extremely friendly and available. Very recommended.   It should be noted, however, that the restaurant was full and the room service could not keep up with the requests and failed on several occasions, with long wait times, among other problems. But nothing to tarnish the overall experience.     \"\\n\"     Hotel, location, catering, decoration, home. Everything is perfect for a romantic moment.\\nThe restaurant is beautiful and you feel at ease quickly.   Attention to dust as polished concrete floor.      Only weak point, the city in itself, but the place is charming.\"\\n     We arrived at Areas in the late afternoon and immediately felt a sense of relaxation. The architecture and design are amazing\\x97concrete, glass and wood. It is like going to a spa and you can feel the tension melt away. Upon arrival they offered us tea and cake in the lounge which was a very nice way to arrive, and set the tone for our stay. We had a beautiful room with large windows across the front of the bedroom with an indoor and outdoor shower and a large deck for lounging. The bed was soft and immensely comfortable\\x97one of the best I have ever slept in. It was quite expensive as compared to other hotels in Portugal and the Eco-design is gorgeous but it lacks basics such as a gym, and yoga is only available on weekends. It definitely needs a gym or daily yoga as there is little to do in the area, yet it is the sort of place where you want to hang out and enjoy the hotel. It was foggy during our stay but that did not adversely impact things. It is a short walk to a beach which is lovely for walking in low tide. Breakfast was fantastic with delicious homemade pastries and freshly cooked eggs. The overall feeling of the hotel is very relaxing and this is reinforced by touches such as the spa music in your room if you flip a switch. There are many things about Areas that we liked and we would return, but there are a few areas for improvement.   At dinner, however, we felt that they were trying too hard to be creative and the combinations did not work well.  One of the staff members suggested we go see the lake on the property. It was more of a pond with an island pavilion and could be lovely but the water is dirty and very unappealing.    he bed was on a concrete platform which was an interesting design feature, but it made for a hazardous trip to the bathroom in the night as we kept bumping the corners of the concrete platform and tripping. Despite this, however, we did not sleep well as we could not get the air conditioning to work--perhaps it is turned off at night? It was cool outside but we found that keeping the sliding doors open meant that we couldn\\'t sleep due to aggressive small flies and the wind.\\n\"     Possible the best hotel I\\'ve had in my life! For me the details make the difference and more small. This hotel is full of great little details that make it contagious nice cozy single special and leave us with a feeling that only the Portuguese can explain, Saudade! !\\nCongratulations to the administrators for building in Portugal something so charming and with people at all concerned ... with the detail!\\n Recommend!        \"\\n     A massive thank you to everyone in the hotel, the spa and the restaurant - this is now one of our favorite hotels in Europe!

       " '\"     We had a truly memorable and delightful stay at Areas do Seixo. After some difficulty in finding it (GPS was helpful), we knew the moment we walked in that this was a special place. The sign for the turn off was quite small; the front door was locked, but immediately opened. Definitely a secluded retreat on a holiday weekend (we checked in on Jan. 1). The seating at the check in desk was swings. Below the clear floors was water. Through the windows you could see the grass roofs of the below-street-level rooms. Each room is unique, we were told. Ours featured a bathroom with a sunken tub/shower, a window for a ceiling, an olive tree growing, and a fireplace. You get the idea. It may not be for everyone, but for us, we got our money\\'s worth. We appreciate innovation, design, beauty, and seclusion. Areas do Seixo had it all. Look at the photos and see if it might be for you too. It is a splurge for sure. But they deliver. For us, Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, California is the only place that has come close.

We know the concept it\\x92s based on the products in the garden (which we really like!), but we can imagine for some guests the choice might be too limited. The jacuzzi was dirty when we got in, which might be blamed on the fact that there wasn\\x92t a roof above the place where the tub was situated. We stayed in Oliviera Princesa and it seemed to be the only room without a roof / roofwindow above this area.     We missed a garbage bin in the hotel room. There was only 1 (tiny) bin in the toilet, and we missed a garbage bin in the sleeping area. \"',\n",

In addition, the fact that someone who prepares the eggs and bacon on request is stupendous. As for dining service, there are no words. I confess that I was very curious because Chef Leonardo Pereira expectations were not completely dashed. It should be noted the courage to have an open kitchen to the living room where you do not hear anything and that everything works almost like an orchestra. Spectacular!   As for the spa, the Moroccan theme is quite interesting. The quality of the massage and sympathy of both masseurs was quite high and I will repeat as soon as possible. ',\n",

       " '        A year later we returned to celebrate that date and we faced an extremely unpleasant situation. When we met in the tub all was well until we turn the jacuzzi and immediately came a nauseating smell and we had to get out of the tub immediately. Baffled by the situation we were watching the water and this was in full of green slime coming out of air vents through which the bubbles are formed. Later when we passed by the reception we reported the event to the employee very gently and shocked by what she had told asked immense apology.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion meant that incidents do happen although this shows a lack of care by the maintenance of the resort. As described on booking.com: \"\"Get the celebrity treatment with world-class service at Areas Do Seixo Charm Hotel & Residences\"\". With this it creates a great expectation treatment. And so we were surprised with the result of our complaint was only an apology. Like any other couple travel a lot and already we passed many hotels and in the middle of so many positive experiences from time to time happen less pleasant situations but has always given us an apology followed by attention to the client. Thing not obtained by the Areias do Seixo and which left us a bit disappointed.',\n",

       " '   In terms of constructive feedback, the only other comment I would make is that we found the evening meals dragged on too long. We stayed for three evenings and found we were left waiting for our food too long during the evenings of Sunday 5th and Tuesday 7th July. The restaurant was extremely busy on each evening. The waiters appeared to be focused on other tables and we were not afforded the opportunity to order additional drinks in between courses. On the evening of Tuesday 7th July, I also had to help myself to cutlery for dessert. We really enjoyed the food which was of an extremely high quality and stood out for its freshness, but it struck me that on each evening the kitchen was a little overwhelmed. In terms of addressing this, I wonder if it might help to remove the tasting menu - it seemed that this proved too much of a distraction and overwhelmed the kitchen with knock-on effects for other diners.     \"',\n",

The bed was soft and immensely comfortable\\x97one of the best I have ever slept in. It was quite expensive as compared to other hotels in Portugal and the Eco-design is gorgeous but it lacks basics such as a gym, and yoga is only available on weekends. It definitely needs a gym or daily yoga as there is little to do in the area, yet it is the sort of place where you want to hang out and enjoy the hotel. It was foggy during our stay but that did not adversely impact things. It is a short walk to a beach which is lovely for walking in low tide. Breakfast was fantastic with delicious homemade pastries and freshly cooked eggs. The overall feeling of the hotel is very relaxing and this is reinforced by touches such as the spa music in your room if you flip a switch. There are many things about Areas that we liked and we would return, but there are a few areas for improvement.   At dinner, however, we felt that they were trying too hard to be creative and the combinations did not work well.  One of the staff members suggested we go see the lake on the property. It was more of a pond with an island pavilion and could be lovely but the water is dirty and very unappealing.    he bed was on a concrete platform which was an interesting design feature, but it made for a hazardous trip to the bathroom in the night as we kept bumping the corners of the concrete platform and tripping. Despite this, however, we did not sleep well as we could not get the air conditioning to work--perhaps it is turned off at night? It was cool outside but we found that keeping the sliding doors open meant that we couldn't sleep due to aggressive small flies and the wind.\",\n",

The sign for the turn off was quite small; the front door was locked, but immediately opened. Definitely a secluded retreat on a holiday weekend (we checked in on Jan. 1). The seating at the check in desk was swings. Below the clear floors was water. Through the windows you could see the grass roofs of the below-street-level rooms. Each room is unique, we were told. Ours featured a bathroom with a sunken tub/shower, a window for a ceiling, an olive tree growing, and a fireplace. You get the idea. It may not be for everyone, but for us, we got our money's worth. We appreciate innovation, design, beauty, and seclusion. Areas do Seixo had it all. Look at the photos and see if it might be for you too. It is a splurge for sure. But they deliver. For us, Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, California is the only place that has come close.

One of the girls in the restaurant sometimes seemed to have a bad day. Not all the time, but sometimes we thought that she didn't really wanted to work right now.     PEDI/MANICURE: Not worth the money! I do get lots of mani/pedis in Hotels but this one was definitely not worth the money. But I should have said STOP immediately when I saw the women entering the room because I looked at her nails (which were kind of eaten and than at her feet - some with naipolish, some without some with a bit of it still on it)... The women, I forgot her name, was really nice and friendly but the treatment was not perfect at all. The color was on my skin besides the nails of my fingers and on the feet she didn't take away dead skin, and, the bit what she did was only with the   razor-thing   (which of course is quicker...)  and not with the normal products that everybody is used too.  You should think about getting another one to do that. It is not professional at all!\",\n",

The rooms are big and bright: they managed to give the idea of ??being outdoors. Our room had an outdoor hot tub and that was finely decorated. The outline level absolutely nothing to say. However, we feel that the problem is that the prices are exorbitant compared to a staff that seems not to notice. It was a gift for our honeymoon (which informed the reception and they were totally unnoticed). For 350 euros per night can not cut grass in front of midday room at six o'clock. Also I don't  want to have a receptionist who treats me as her best friend, when she is not. With few exceptions, of course, but the staff (employee restaurant to the cleaners who were playing loudly as if in a desert) have confused the warmth and availability with lack of professionalism: the hotel still travels to order hundreds of euros per room.

It should be noted the courage to have an open kitchen to the living room where you do not hear anything and that everything works almost like an orchestra. Spectacular!

We stayed for three evenings and found we were left waiting for our food too long during the evenings of Sunday 5th and Tuesday 7th July. The restaurant was extremely busy on each evening. The waiters appeared to be focused on other tables and we were not afforded the opportunity to order additional drinks in between courses. On the evening of Tuesday 7th July, I also had to help myself to cutlery for dessert. We really enjoyed the food which was of an extremely high quality and stood out for its freshness, but it struck me that on each evening the kitchen was a little overwhelmed. In terms of addressing this, I wonder if it might help to remove the tasting menu - it seemed that this proved too much of a distraction and overwhelmed the kitchen with knock-on effects for other diners.',\n",

Our advice: go back to basics when you can not do the star cuisine. Anyway the overall experience interesting but not for everybody: amateur bohemian atmosphere this is for you, if not go your way.

It is like going to a spa and you can feel the tension melt away. Upon arrival they offered us tea and cake in the lounge which was a very nice way to arrive, and set the tone for our stay. We had a beautiful room with large windows across the front of the bedroom with an indoor and outdoor shower and a large deck for lounging. The bed was soft and immensely comfortable\\x97one of the best I have ever slept in. It was quite expensive as compared to other hotels in Portugal and the Eco-design is gorgeous but it lacks basics such as a gym, and yoga is only available on weekends. It definitely needs a gym or daily yoga as there is little to do in the area, yet it is the sort of place where you want to hang out and enjoy the hotel. It was foggy during our stay but that did not adversely impact things. It is a short walk to a beach which is lovely for walking in low tide. Breakfast was fantastic with delicious homemade pastries and freshly cooked eggs. The overall feeling of the hotel is very relaxing and this is reinforced by touches such as the spa music in your room if you flip a switch. There are many things about Areas that we liked and we would return, but there are a few areas for improvement.   At dinner, however, we felt that they were trying too hard to be creative and the combinations did not work well.  One of the staff members suggested we go see the lake on the property. It was more of a pond with an island pavilion and could be lovely but the water is dirty and very unappealing.    he bed was on a concrete platform which was an interesting design feature, but it made for a hazardous trip to the bathroom in the night as we kept bumping the corners of the concrete platform and tripping. Despite this, however, we did not sleep well as we could not get the air conditioning to work--perhaps it is turned off at night? It was cool outside but we found that keeping the sliding doors open meant that we couldn't sleep due to aggressive small flies and the wind.\",\n",
